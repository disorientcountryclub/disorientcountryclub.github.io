   <BR>2025 THEME: MATERIALS OF INTRIGUE</h3>
<br>
  <h6 class="w3-center"><font color=#fcc400> For this experience, we aspire to the formation of new, collective core memories.<P>

    Primal ideas executed with refined style will allow us to explore the infinite dilation of the current moment, fabric extravaganzas, overhanging crystalline substructures that stimulate psychosomaticism, romantic yet awakened networks of emergent thought, symbiotic flames that cast everlasting illumination, labyrinthine geometric tesselations ... wrapped in microbiomes of emotion.</h6>
</font>
<br>

  <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">OUR ART + YOUR ART</H3>
We invite you to bring your magic to plug it into the vortex. Disorient Country Club is an ephemeral dream that exists for one weekend only. Together we ride the spiral of this continually morphing long weekend of art, theme camps, art cars, art boats, and electronic and live music.

      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">GET INVOLVED</h5> <P>
      The mission of Disorient is to make people happy. As we get bigger and more organized, it’s important to remember that what makes Disorient special is that by joining together, we can bring happiness to more and more people. That is what we do on the playa. It is what we strive to do off the playa. Volunteer to join us. It is our foundation. It is our heart. Join the volunteer squad. Help us make the magic that is the Country Club experience. It is not a great way to meet new people and get involved, it is the BEST way. You will truly feel a part of the fold once you have been a part of the creation of a Disorient event. Want to volunteer for Country Club? Unsure of what you can do? Do not fret, my friend, no specialized skills are necessary.

          <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">GLOW STICKS</h5>
      In 2017, due to some negligent littering of glow sticks, glow bracelets, glow necklaces, etc, clean up was a problem. Since then, our policy has been to ban these single use items. Please DO NOT bring them. We invite you to explore fiber optics, EL Wire and led strips to light up your night experience.
       <BR>
<P>
         <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">FIRES</h5>
    Personal small fires are allowed at your camp, but must be kept off the ground, in fire dishes, and in well-cleared areas.  Extreme care must be practiced to keep from scorching the land.   Fires for large groups will be coordinated by Disorient production team.
      <BR>
      <P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">DOGS</h5>
      Dogs are welcome, but please be aware that sound can reach levels that are harmful to dogs’ sensitive ears. Please keep dogs away from the stage areas.<br>
<P>
        <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">TICKS</h5>
      Ticks are part of camping in Upstate New York. Please come armed with DEET and Permethrin.<br>
<P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">PORNJ GUARD </h5>
      Pornj Guards will be on site to help maintain a safe and consensual environment for all campers. Campers behaving aggressively will be warned once.  If a second intervention is necessary, offending campers will be asked to leave.
<br>
<P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">WOOD FIRE SAUNA CABIN "THE ALL NIGHTER"</H5>
      Open 24/7 for all over the age of 18. <br>Use good judgement with the onsite sauna. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use without direct guardian supervision.
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center"><img src="assets/sauna.gif" width="60%"></h5><br>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LAKE</H5>
       Swimming is permitted in the lake. Please feel free to bring floats, rafts, small boats etc. There is no lifeguard on duty, children under the age of 18 are not permitted to swim without direct guardian supervision.
<BR>
<P>
<h5 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400><B>LNT CODE OF CONDUCT</B></font></H5>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEAVE NO TRACE</H5>
      Country Club is a pack it in, pack it out experience. There are no trash cans onsite.<BR>
<P>


      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT’S LNT?  WHAT’S MOOP? </H6>
      LNT is Leave No Trace that you were there. MOOP is Matter Out Of Place.  Anything that is not natural to the Country Club grounds is MOOP.  Flakes and ashes from burnt material also counts as MOOP.  You take out every scrap of material you brought in. That includes all your garbage.  DO NOT dispose of  anything on the ground.  Do a thorough MOOP sweep of your campsite before you leave.
      <BR>
      <P>

      <BR>
      <P>
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PLASTIC</H6>
      Plastic disposable cups, just don’t.  Bring your reusable cup. <BR>
      Don’t throw plastic into fires.  The fumes will make you feel funny, and not the good way.
      <!-- <img src="assets/dpr.png" alt="disorient country club" width="50%"> <BR>
      Premiering at CCXii, for the first time at a Disorient event and aligned with our DIY mantra, we will operate our very own plastic recycling plant complete with a 2.2kw shredder. Everyone is invited to participate: bring your plastic waste free of organic matter to the Disorient Plastic Recycling plant. All plastics welcome. Plastic ONLY please. Thank you for rinsing food-related items first.<br> -->
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">HIDE YOUR GARBAGE BAGS</H6>
      People tend to throw their garbage into whatever open trash bag is available.  If you do not want to take out loads of other people’s trash, consider a tarp to cover your trash.  Also, it makes it easier to separate trash from recycling.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PACKAGING </H6>
      You can reduce the amount of trash you have to take out by removing any excess packaging from your supplies before you arrive at the event.
      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CIGARETTES </H6>
      Carry a butt can.  Use it.  Best practice- roll your smokes so you are not leaving filters to be picked up by our rockstar Disengage Team.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEND A HAND </H6>
      Some campers will be coming via bus and cannot bring out bags of trash.  Please help these people if you can.  If you can’t take extra garbage out, please gift some trash bags to the Disengage Crew.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CARDBOARD </H6>
      Do not burn it.  It surrounds the fire as a mess that is impossible to clean up. <BR>

After all these years, words and good intents, we are still in what feels like the Stone Age of plastic recycling.

the "NOW*HERE zONE" is an interactive art exchange treasure box nestled in the woods  inviting participants to give and receive materials of intrigue in the form of art, words, objects—blurring the boundaries of time. Each exchange links past creators with future recipients, forming a collective present. Please accept our gifts as a reminder of the NOW and our interconnectedness. Be here now and find the present in the presence.    This evolving space is a meditation on presence, impermanence, and the interconnected nature of time. It reminds us that everything that has ever been and will ever be already exists—right here, in this moment. In the act of exchange, we step into the eternal now—into the nowhere, which is everywhere: NOW HERE<p>

"This Must be the Place:" <br>
Welcome home. This Must Be The Place is a portal disguised as a camp, nestled between the ordinary and the magical. We’re a crew of dreamers, dancers, builders, and late-night philosophers who’ve come together to create a cozy, vibrant haven at the Country Club. Our camp is about grounding in the now—through connection, joy, and just the right amount of weird.<br>
By day, find shade, chill beats, massage stations and restorative elixirs at our shady chill space, where strangers become family. When night falls… well, that’s when the magic really starts. Expect spontaneous dance parties, storytelling under the stars, and interactive art installations that ask the big questions (and answer them with glitter).<br>
We’re fully fueled by love, intention, and sensation. Whether you're stopping by for a moment or moving in for a while—if you feel it, then yes... This Must Be The Place.<p>

As the sun casts its golden glow, you’ll transform your collected finds into ethereal blueprints of nature using the alchemy of cyanotype printing.<P>

Under the open sky, watch as the sun’s rays develop your one-of-a-kind Prussian blue masterpiece—an imprint of the wild, forever preserved in deep, moody hues. This is more than a workshop; it’s an invitation to slow down, observe, and create a lasting dialogue between shadow and light.<BR>

Join us and let the landscape leave its mark on you.<P>

                 The mountains are unpredictable! We have a 24 hour wood sauna cabin to maintain good vibes, and a completely tented Disorient Club House with couches. Over the years, we have made ourselves comfortable by focusing on creating small art cabins and others tented adventures. As many camping spots are in the woods, we encourage you to bring a tarp to create your own weather protected oasis to chill at with your friends. Yes, you can tie to the trees, we just ask that you be mindful as you do it. <br>
