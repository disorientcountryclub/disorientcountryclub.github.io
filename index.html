   <BR>2024 THEME: POSSIBILITIES OF PATTERN</h3>
<br>
  <h6 class="w3-center"><font color=#fcc400> An invitation to explore recognition of the self similar repeating patterns that create the conditioned phenomena available to experience in this world. A flexibility and rigor to recognize and interact with the apparent superstructures, finding skillful ways through, with, past and beyond.<P>
  
   Ideas explored: coherence/decoherence, omniinterregulated structuring, hot swapping capable DNA sequencers, Japanese metabolism architects, Drop City, torus knot topopolis warehouse massives, chronostasis cowboys, Vector Equilibrium jitterbugging, subtle harmonic benders, newly apparent aperiodic monotile tessellations, holobiant upgrades through groove transpositionists</h6>
</font>
<br>

  <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">OUR ART + YOUR ART</H3>
We invite you to bring your magic to plug it into the vortex. Disorient Country Club is an ephemeral dream that exists for one weekend only. Together we ride the spiral of this continually morphing long weekend of art, theme camps, art cars, art boats, and electronic and live music.

      The mission of Disorient is to make people happy. As we get bigger and more organized, it’s important to remember that what makes Disorient special is that by joining together, we can bring happiness to more and more people. That is what we do on the playa. It is what we strive to do off the playa. Volunteer to join us. It is our foundation. It is our heart. Join the volunteer squad. Help us make the magic that is the Country Club experience. It is not a great way to meet new people and get involved, it is the BEST way. You will truly feel a part of the fold once you have been a part of the creation of a Disorient event. Want to volunteer for Country Club? Unsure of what you can do? Do not fret, my friend, no specialized skills are necessary.

          <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">GLOW STICKS</h5>
      In 2017, due to some negligent littering of glow sticks, glow bracelets, glow necklaces, etc, clean up was a problem. Since then, our policy has been to ban these single use items. Please DO NOT bring them. We invite you to explore fiber optics, EL Wire and led strips to light up your night experience.
       <BR>
<P>
         <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">FIRES</h5>
    Personal small fires are allowed at your camp, but must be kept off the ground, in fire dishes, and in well-cleared areas.  Extreme care must be practiced to keep from scorching the land.   Fires for large groups will be coordinated by Disorient production team.  
      <BR>
      <P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">DOGS</h5>
      Dogs are welcome, but please be aware that sound can reach levels that are harmful to dogs’ sensitive ears. Please keep dogs away from the stage areas.<br>
<P>
        <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">TICKS</h5>
      Ticks are part of camping in Upstate New York. Please come armed with DEET and Permethrin.<br>
<P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">PORNJ GUARD </h5>
      Pornj Guards will be on site to help maintain a safe and consensual environment for all campers. Campers behaving aggressively will be warned once.  If a second intervention is necessary, offending campers will be asked to leave.
<br>
<P>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">WOOD FIRE SAUNA CABIN "THE ALL NIGHTER"</H5>
      Open 24/7 for all over the age of 18. <br>Use good judgement with the onsite sauna. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use without direct guardian supervision.
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center"><img src="assets/sauna.gif" width="60%"></h5><br>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LAKE</H5>
       Swimming is permitted in the lake. Please feel free to bring floats, rafts, small boats etc. There is no lifeguard on duty, children under the age of 18 are not permitted to swim without direct guardian supervision.

<h5 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400><B>LNT CODE OF CONDUCT</B></font></H5>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEAVE NO TRACE</H5>
      Country Club is a pack it in, pack it out experience. There are no trash cans onsite.<BR>
<P>


      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT’S LNT?  WHAT’S MOOP? </H6>
      LNT is Leave No Trace that you were there. MOOP is Matter Out Of Place.  Anything that is not natural to the Country Club grounds is MOOP.  Flakes and ashes from burnt material also counts as MOOP.  You take out every scrap of material you brought in. That includes all your garbage.  DO NOT dispose of  anything on the ground.  Do a thorough MOOP sweep of your campsite before you leave.
      <BR>
      <P>
      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400><B>LNT BEST PRACTICES</B></font></H6>
      <BR>
      <P>
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PLASTIC</H6>
      Plastic disposable cups, just don’t.  Bring your reusable cup. <BR>
      Don’t throw plastic into fires.  The fumes will make you feel funny, and not the good way.
      <img src="assets/dpr.png" alt="disorient country club" width="50%"> <BR>
      Premiering at CCXii, for the first time at a Disorient event and aligned with our DIY mantra, we will operate our very own plastic recycling plant complete with a 2.2kw shredder. Everyone is invited to participate: bring your plastic waste free of organic matter to the Disorient Plastic Recycling plant. All plastics welcome. Plastic ONLY please. Thank you for rinsing food-related items first.<br>
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">HIDE YOUR GARBAGE BAGS</H6>
      People tend to throw their garbage into whatever open trash bag is available.  If you do not want to take out loads of other people’s trash, consider a tarp to cover your trash.  Also, it makes it easier to separate trash from recycling.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PACKAGING </H6>
      You can reduce the amount of trash you have to take out by removing any excess packaging from your supplies before you arrive at the event.
      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CIGARETTES </H6>
      Carry a butt can.  Use it.  Best practice- roll your smokes so you are not leaving filters to be picked up by our rockstar Disengage Team.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEND A HAND </H6>
      Some campers will be coming via bus and cannot bring out bags of trash.  Please help these people if you can.  If you can’t take extra garbage out, please gift some trash bags to the Disengage Crew.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CARDBOARD </H6>
      Do not burn it.  It surrounds the fire as a mess that is impossible to clean up. <BR>

        <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400>CAN I HAVE A PERSONAL FIRE?</font></H3>

              After arrival and setup, all cars must be moved to our gravel parking lot. If you want to bring your car onsite and camp near your vehicle please purchase a car camping pass on our ticketing page.<br>
               There are a limited number of car camping passes available enabling you to camp with your car.

              <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400>WHAT IS THE CAMPING SITUATION</font></H3>
                 We issue a map each year to help guide you in making your choice of where to post up. The land encompasses 250 acres, so rest assured there is space for you. This is a wild off grid experience, you can drive our forest roads logging roads to find a perfect hideaway. <br>
                 Both forest and field camping available.

                 The mountains are unpredictable! We have a 24 hour wood sauna cabin to maintain good vibes, and a completely tented Disorient Club House with couches. Over the years, we have made ourselves comfortable by focusing on creating small art cabins and others tented adventures. As many camping spots are in the woods, we encourage you to bring a tarp to create your own weather protected oasis to chill at with your friends. Yes, you can tie to the trees, we just ask that you be mindful as you do it. <br>

                   <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center"><font color=#fcc400>CAN I BRING MY CHILDREN?</font></H3>
                    Yes, children 8 and under do not need a ticket. Children ages 9-17 will need to purchase a ticket. Children up to and including the age of 17 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who is in the immediate vicinity and within line of sight of the minor. If minors are found unsupervised, the entire family may be asked to pack up and leave Disorient Country Club immediately, without a ticket refund. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use lake, boat or sauna unsupervised.
