      The mission of Disorient is to make people happy. As we get bigger and more organized, it’s important to remember that what makes Disorient special is that by joining together, we can bring happiness to more and more people. That is what we do on the playa. It is what we strive to do off the playa. Volunteer to join us. It is our foundation. It is our heart. Join the volunteer squad. Help us make the magic that is the Country Club experience. It is not a great way to meet new people and get involved, it is the BEST way. You will truly feel a part of the fold once you have been a part of the creation of a Disorient event. Want to volunteer for Country Club? Unsure of what you can do? Do not fret, my friend, no specialized skills are necessary.

      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">PORNJ GUARD </h5>
      Pornj Guards will be on site to help maintain a safe and consensual environment for all campers. Campers behaving aggressively will be warned once.  If a second intervention is necessary, offending campers will be asked to leave.
<br>
      <img src="assets/sauna.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="18"><br> <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">SAUNA</H5>
      Use good judgement with the onsite sauna. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use without direct guardian supervision.

      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LAKE</H5>
       <BR>Swimming is permitted in the lake. Please feel free to bring floats, rafts, small boats etc. There is no lifeguard on duty, children under the age of 18 are not permitted to swim without direct guardian supervision.
<BR>
      <h5 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEAVE NO TRACE</H5>
      Country Club is a pack it in, pack it out experience. There are no trash cans onsite.<BR>



      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT’S LNT?  WHAT’S MOOP? </H6>
      LNT is Leave No Trace that you were there. MOOP is Matter Out Of Place.  Anything that is not natural to the Country Club grounds is MOOP.  Flakes and ashes from burnt material also counts as MOOP.  You take out every scrap of material you brought in. That includes all your garbage.  DO NOT dispose of  anything on the ground.  Do a thorough MOOP sweep of your campsite before you leave.
      <BR>
      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">LNT CODE OF CONDUCT</H6>
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PLASTIC</H6>
      Plastic disposable cups, just don’t.  Bring your reusable cup. <BR>
      Don’t throw plastic into fires.  The fumes will make you feel funny, and not the good way. <BR>
        <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">HIDE YOUR GARBAGE BAGS</H6>
      People tend to throw their garbage into whatever open trash bag is available.  If you do not want to take out loads of other people’s trash, consider a tarp to cover your trash.  Also, it makes it easier to separate trash from recycling.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">PACKAGING </H6>
      You can reduce the amount of trash you have to take out by removing any excess packaging from your supplies before you arrive at the event.
      <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CIGARETTES </H6>
      Carry a butt can.  Use it.  Best practice- roll your smokes so you are not leaving filters to be picked up by our rockstar Disengage Team.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">LEND A HAND </H6>
      Some campers will be coming via bus and cannot bring out bags of trash.  Please help these people if you can.  If you can’t take extra garbage out, please gift some trash bags to the Disengage Crew.
       <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center">CARDBOARD </H6>
      Do not burn it.  It becomes a flakey mess that is impossible to clean up. <BR>

“Star Gate”<BR>
During the summer we see the winter sky at night, the concept is to create one of the night visible constellations within the Star Gate with a shamanic journey activating the star portal of Fomalhaut - the star that represents the voice of humanity. It is like being inside an astrolabe. Sadamelik and Ancha Aquarius conjoin Enif of Pegasus, Fomalhaut of Piscis Australis, and Deneb of Cygnu. All are humanitarian and visionary stars. Aquarium, the humanitarian water bearer nourishes the body of humanity which is articulated by Pisces Australis and embodies the essence of human society. Fomalhaut of Piscis Australis is the fish's mouth into which the nourishing Aquarian waters flow, and through which humanity speaks. Therefore the star Fomalhaut represents the voice of humanity. People with prominent placement with Fomalhaut have a need to speak for humanity as a whole and about humanity's fundamental needs. They seek ways to sculpt an evolved universal human society, one free from segregation. These stories will be carved into the piece, swirling in with the punctured star-gazing portals incorporating the movements of the night sky to the stories within. Star Gate is an observatory, a space ship, that never leaves the ground.<P>

  “Beeps and Tweets<BR>
  A curious collection of sounds designed to make the listener feel differently about their surroundings.<P>
