The mission of Disorient is to make people happy. As we get bigger and more organized, it's important to remember that what makes Disorient special is that by joining together, we can bring happiness to more and more people. That is what we do on the playa. It is what we strive to do off the playa. Volunteer to join us. It is our foundation. It is our heart. Join the volunteer squad. Help us make the magic that is the Country Club experience. It is not a great way to meet new people and get involved, it is the BEST way. You will truly feel a part of the fold once you have been a part of the creation of a Disorient event.

Want to volunteer for Country Club? Unsure of what you can do? Do not fret, my friend, no specialized skills are necessary. We will find a place for you, we promise.
