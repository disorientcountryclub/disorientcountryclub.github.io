## Car Camping Pass

A limited amount of Car Camping Passes are available for sale on our ticketing website.

## Setting Up Camp

Please note we have designated QUIET CAMPING. We ask you to respect those wishing a quieter experience in these areas. Open camping is available beyond the marked spots, the site encompasses over 100 acres.

**Feel free to follow the forest roads and camp in whatever corner of the forest calls to you.**

**The only limitations are camps cannot be setup where there is placed art and roads/paths must be kept open.**

Please check in at the gate with any questions and our Lady of the Manor will assist you in locating a perfect camping spot for you and your crew. We encourage you to bring EZ ups and other shade structures to make your experience more comfortable. Hot tip: 6-8 inch lag bolts combined with an impact driver will make your tie down experience modern and easy.

*We strongly encourage you to bring a tarp and rope to hang a shade/rain common area for your camp. Much of the land is dense forest suitable to easily rigging a relaxing kingdom. Lay into this green lush oasis. Glamping encouraged.*

## RVs

Country Club is minimally RV friendly. Limited number of RV passes available. The site does not offer RV hookups. All RVs must park within the designated RV Camping Site if weather is forecasted for wet ground. If conditions are decent, RVs may be placed along the grounds.
