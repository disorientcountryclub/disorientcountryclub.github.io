## Self Reliance

### We Do Not Provide Water

There is no water provided at Country Club.
There are no showers, but we provide a sauna. You must bring all the water you will need for the weekend. Recommendation is a little more than 1 gallon per person per day for drinking, cooking and cleaning. There is a local grocery store 10 mins away, in and outs allowed while gate is open. Gate is closed overnight.

### You Need to Bring

- Photo ID
- Tent
- Food
- Beverages/Water
- Cooking supplies
- Utensils
- Reusable cup
- Bug Repellent aka DEET / Permethrin
