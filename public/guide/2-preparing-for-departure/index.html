<h2 id="things-to-know">Things to Know</h2>
<h3 id="glow-sticks">Glow Sticks</h3>
<p>In 2017, due to some negligent littering of glow sticks, glow bracelets, glow necklaces, etc, clean up was a problem. Since then, our policy has been to ban these single use items. Please DO NOT bring them. We invite you to explore fiber optics, EL Wire and led strips to light up your night experience.</p>
<h3 id="fires">Fires</h3>
<p>Personal small fires are allowed at your camp, but must be kept off the ground, in fire dishes, and in well-cleared areas. Extreme care must be practiced to keep from scorching the land. Fires for large groups will be coordinated by Disorient production team.</p>
<h3 id="dogs">Dogs</h3>
<p>Dogs are welcome, but please be aware that sound can reach levels that are harmful to dogs&rsquo; sensitive ears. Please keep dogs away from the stage areas.</p>
<h3 id="ticks">Ticks</h3>
<p>Ticks are part of camping in Upstate New York. Please come armed with DEET and Permethrin.</p>
<h3 id="pornj-guard">Pornj Guard</h3>
<p>Pornj Guards will be on site to help maintain a safe and consensual environment for all campers. Campers behaving aggressively will be warned once. If a second intervention is necessary, offending campers will be asked to leave.</p>
<h3 id="wood-fire-sauna-cabin-the-all-nighter">Wood Fire Sauna Cabin &ldquo;The All Nighter&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Open 24/7 for all over the age of 18. Use good judgement with the onsite sauna. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use without direct guardian supervision.</p>
<h3 id="lake">Lake</h3>
<p>Swimming is permitted in the lake. Please feel free to bring floats, rafts, small boats etc. There is no lifeguard on duty, children under the age of 18 are not permitted to swim without direct guardian supervision.</p>
<h2 id="lnt-code-of-conduct">LNT Code of Conduct</h2>
<h3 id="leave-no-trace">Leave No Trace</h3>
<p>Country Club is a pack it in, pack it out experience. There are no trash cans onsite.</p>
<h3 id="whats-lnt-whats-moop">What&rsquo;s LNT? What&rsquo;s MOOP?</h3>
<p>LNT is Leave No Trace that you were there. MOOP is Matter Out Of Place. Anything that is not natural to the Country Club grounds is MOOP. Flakes and ashes from burnt material also counts as MOOP. You take out every scrap of material you brought in. That includes all your garbage. DO NOT dispose of anything on the ground. Do a thorough MOOP sweep of your campsite before you leave.</p>
<h3 id="lnt-best-practices">LNT Best Practices</h3>
<p><strong>Plastic</strong>
Plastic disposable cups, just don&rsquo;t. Bring your reusable cup. Don&rsquo;t throw plastic into fires. The fumes will make you feel funny, and not the good way.</p>
<p><strong>Hide Your Garbage Bags</strong>
People tend to throw their garbage into whatever open trash bag is available. If you do not want to take out loads of other people&rsquo;s trash, consider a tarp to cover your trash. Also, it makes it easier to separate trash from recycling.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging</strong>
You can reduce the amount of trash you have to take out by removing any excess packaging from your supplies before you arrive at the event.</p>
<p><strong>Cigarettes</strong>
Carry a butt can. Use it. Best practice- roll your smokes so you are not leaving filters to be picked up by our rockstar Disengage Team.</p>
<p><strong>Lend a Hand</strong>
Some campers will be coming via bus and cannot bring out bags of trash. Please help these people if you can. If you can&rsquo;t take extra garbage out, please gift some trash bags to the Disengage Crew.</p>
<p><strong>Cardboard</strong>
Do not burn it. It surrounds the fire as a mess that is impossible to clean up.</p>
