<p>We issue a map each year to help guide you in making your choice of where to post up. The land encompasses 250 acres, so rest assured there is space for you. This is a wild off grid experience, you can drive our forest roads logging roads to find a perfect hideaway.</p>

<p>The mountains are unpredictable! We have a 24 hour wood sauna cabin to maintain good vibes, and a completely tented Disorient Club House with couches. Over the years, we have made ourselves comfortable by focusing on creating small art cabins and others tented adventures. As many camping spots are in the woods, we encourage you to bring a tarp to create your own weather protected oasis to chill at with your friends. Yes, you can tie to the trees, we just ask that you be mindful as you do it.</p>

<p>If minors are found unsupervised, the entire family may be asked to pack up and leave Disorient Country Club immediately, without a ticket refund. Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use lake, boat or sauna unsupervised.</p>
