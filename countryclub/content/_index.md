## Your invitation

We have the destination, book your ticket aboard. Get with Disorient on the mothership as we voyage for 4 days and 4 nights into the interstellar unknown.

Join Disorient for year 14 of our annual journey of deep chilling, off-the-grid futurist relaxation. Country Club is a lake and lush green woodland oasis where blissful self-reliance meets massive multiplayer techno and technology participation.

Explore a constantly shifting blank canvas of music, art, and performance. Country Club is a fundraiser organized by an all volunteer team. All profits are used for Disorient art creations at Burning Man.

# Theme
&nbsp;

For this experience, we aspire to the formation of new, collective core memories.

&nbsp;

Primal ideas executed with refined style will allow us to explore the infinite dilation of the current moment, fabric extravaganzas, overhanging crystalline substructures that stimulate psychosomaticism, romantic yet awakened networks of emergent thought, symbiotic flames that cast everlasting illumination, labyrinthine geometric tesselations ... wrapped in microbiomes of emotion.
