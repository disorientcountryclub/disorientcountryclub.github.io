Both forest and field camping available.

## What if it Rains?

The mountains are unpredictable! We have a 24 hour wood sauna cabin to maintain good vibes, and a completely tented Disorient Club House with couches. Over the years, we have made ourselves comfortable by focusing on creating small art cabins and others tented adventures. As many camping spots are in the woods, we encourage you to bring a tarp to create your own weather protected oasis to chill at with your friends. Yes, you can tie to the trees, we just ask that you be mindful as you do it.
