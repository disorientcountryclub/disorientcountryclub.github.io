### LNT Code of Conduct

Country Club is a pack it in, pack it out experience. There are no trash cans onsite.

### What's LNT? What's MOOP?

LNT is Leave No Trace that you were there. MOOP is Matter Out Of Place. Anything that is not natural to the Country Club grounds is MOOP. Flakes and ashes from burnt material also counts as MOOP. You take out every scrap of material you brought in. That includes all your garbage. DO NOT dispose of anything on the ground. Do a thorough MOOP sweep of your campsite before you leave.

### LNT Best Practices

**Plastic**
Plastic disposable cups, just don't. Bring your reusable cup. Don't throw plastic into fires. The fumes will make you feel funny, and not the good way.

**Hide Your Garbage Bags**
People tend to throw their garbage into whatever open trash bag is available. If you do not want to take out loads of other people's trash, consider a tarp to cover your trash. Also, it makes it easier to separate trash from recycling.

**Packaging**
You can reduce the amount of trash you have to take out by removing any excess packaging from your supplies before you arrive at the event.

**Cigarettes**
Carry a butt can. Use it. Best practice- roll your smokes so you are not leaving filters to be picked up by our rockstar Disengage Team.

**Lend a Hand**
Some campers will be coming via bus and cannot bring out bags of trash. Please help these people if you can. If you can't take extra garbage out, please gift some trash bags to the Disengage Crew.

**Cardboard**
Do not burn it. It surrounds the fire as a mess that is impossible to clean up.
