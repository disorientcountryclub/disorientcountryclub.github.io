## What If It Rains?

The mountains are unpredictable! We have a 24 hour wood sauna cabin to maintain good vibes, and a completely tented Disorient Club House with couches. We encourage you to bring a tarp to create your own weather protected oasis.

All children need a ticket. Children under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who is in the immediate vicinity and within line of sight of the minor AT ALL TIMES.
